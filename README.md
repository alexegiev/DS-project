# Distributed Systems Project

## Folder Structure

1. `backend`: first assignment.
1. `gui`: second assignment.
1. `test`: some changes to the backend for compatibility with the frontend
   (Android application)

## Usage

1. To start the backend, run `app` inside `test` after importing into IntelliJ
   (or just with Maven).

   **IMPORTANT**: in MyApplication's `ClientThread`, on
   line 45 you will have to change `"localhost"` to the IPv4 address of the
   device you are running `Master` from.

1. Start the frontend application "MyApplication" inside Android Studio.
